description: "Lean more about the design and the constraints we had when developing a zero-configuration query language at eKee"
---

When I started eKee, the idea was pretty simple: permit any kind of application to
connect with each other and automate their data exchange. But, for privacy reasons,
I wanted to develop a technology able to not store the data: just permits the
exchanges.

Of course, we had to make compromises along the way. But, with a query language able
to run without configuration, you'll see that we come pretty close. In this article
I'll talk more about:

- how this query language was designed,
- how we managed to make it handle different kind of databases (Both SQL & NoSQL),
- what are the main constraints when wanting to get rid of the need of a configuration.

In order to make it fit into a digeastable content, the implementation tricks and
pitfalls will be focused on the support of SQL databases. This use case is the most
tricky and interesting.
